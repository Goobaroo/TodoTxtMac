        <h1>Version 1.6.0</h1>
        <h2>Enhancements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Added full undo/redo support (Command+Z, Command+Shift+Z).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To enable undo/redo support that works with TodoTxtMac's aggressive "save after every change" functionality, TodoTxtMac now explicitly saves the file after each change rather than relying on Mac OS X's autosave functionality. If you are working with existing todo.txt files, you will likely not notice any difference. If you are working with an unsaved todo.txt file, however, you now will be prompted to save after every change until you save the file.</li>
        </ul>
