        <h1>Version 2.1.0</h1>
        <h2>Enhancements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Changed threshold state to have four values: no threshold date, threshold before today, threshold is today, and threshold after today. Threshold state is now defined the same way as it is in SwiftoDo for iOS.</li>
            <li>Added "hide future tasks (threshold filter)" option. This allows you to hide tasks with a threshold date that is in the future, regardless of what filter options you have selected.</li>
            <li>Changed layout of preferences window.</li>
            <li>Added links to the Help menu to the Plaintext Productivity web site, which contains tips and useful information about using todo.txt.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fixed a bug related to the metadata window showing unexpectedly after it has been dismissed.</li>
        </ul>
