        <h1>Version 1.2.7</h1>
        <h2>Enhancements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Added feature, found in Preferences > Startup, to open a default todo.txt file on launch. This feature is useful when you have either or both of the following General Systems Preferences enabled: "Close windows when quitting an app" and "Recent Items: None". If you do not have those General System Preference, you do not need to set the default todo.txt file, but it will not be harmful it you do.
            </li>
            <li>
            - Added a "Close All" alternate File menu item and keyboard shortcut (Command+Option+W).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
